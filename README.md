# HTML-CSS

## Task 6

This task involves creating a card element

Used CSS properties such as 
- **background-color**: for background colour
- **color**: to change text color
- **font-size**: to change the font size of text
- **padding**: used to change the space of elements inside a block
- **border-radius**: used to change border radius
- **margin**: to alter the space surrounding the block
- **display: grid**: to create a grid layout
- **grid-template-columns**: to define the columns of the grid
- **1fr**: to allocate one fraction of the available space in a grid container
- **gap**: to define the space between items in a flex container
- **media query**: to apply different styles for different screen sizes
- **hover**: to change the style of an element when the mouse is over it
- **box-shadow**: to add shadow effects around an element
- **z-index**: to control the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap
- **visibility**: to show or hide an element without changing the layout
- **transform**: to apply 2D or 3D transformations to an element, such as rotate, scale, or translate
- **#menu-toggle:checked**: to apply styles to an element when a checkbox or radio button with the id "menu-toggle" is checked
- **:target**: to apply styles to an element when its id matches the fragment identifier of the URL
- **transition**: The `transition` property allows you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration) when an element changes from one state to another.
- **animation**: The `animation` property allows you to animate the transition of an element from one style to another. You can control the timing, duration, and other details of how the animation sequence should progress.
- **@keyframes**: The `@keyframes` rule specifies the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence. It defines what styles the element will have at certain times. You can use percentages to specify when the styles should change, or use `from` and `to` to define the start and end points.
